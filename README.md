# Personal Bio Site

## Description
This is a website I created chronicling my time at Nashville Software School. It contains a tid-bit of information about myself, my interests, and my interest in computer programming. The site has a list of all the technologies I have learned at NSS thus far, and with more time it will grow ever larger. Also, it displays two projects I have completed during my time at NSS, (learn more about them on the site) and contains my contact information as well.
